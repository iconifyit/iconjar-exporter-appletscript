# IconJarExtractor

This AppleScript droplet extracts icons from an IconJar archive and renames the icons using the tags set in IconJar.

## Usage

1. Download this script to your Mac computer and extract the ZIP file. 
2. Double-click the file named `JSON Helper.zip` and copy the extracted file to your `Applications` folder.
3. Drop 1 or more IconJar files onto the IconJarExtractor droplet.
4. The script will create a folder on your desktop named `iconjar-extractor`
5. The icons will be extracted from your IconJar file and renamed using the tags you have specified in IconJar. If no tags have been specified, the name of the icons will be used. If no name has been specified, the script will error out.
6. The renamed icons will be saved in a ZIP file in `~/Desktop/icon-extractor/{name}-{uuid}/out`

## What is this for?

Icon marketplaces like Iconfinder can accept ZIP uploads and will use the names of your icons to automatically tag the icons. This script allows you to extract the icons from your IconJar files, rename them, and quickly upload them to Iconfinder without having to spend time manually re-tagging the icons.

## Reporting a Bug

Please report any issues to https://github.com/iconifyit/iconjar-exporter-appletscript/issues or via email at scott_at_atomic_lotus_dot_net.

When reporting a bug, please include as much detail as possible including:

- The year and model of your Mac computer
- The version of MacOS running on your computer
- The IconJar file you're trying to extract would also be very helpful

## Support

I am happy to provide limited support at no charge. I am also available for hire for custom scripts and more complex support issues.
